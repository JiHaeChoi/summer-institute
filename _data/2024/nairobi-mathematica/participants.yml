At the moment, I am finalizing on my dissertation that incorporates climate modeling under NEX-GDDP-CMIP6 global circulation models and knits it to extremes in weather for regional context with agricultural sector at the core. My interests have been to apply the scientific knowledge in solving local and regional key issues while leveraging on informed evidence based scientific research. What matters of them all is how then Am I able to communicate this scientific information to the policy makers so as to aid in dissemination and ameliorating the impacts associated with it. In dealing with large climate datasets, it calls for great computational skills so as to be able to effectively manipulate the datasets and deduce findings from them in a fast and efficient manner. This is where data analysis in python is a competent skillset to aide in my research as I advance in the early career scientist field. All and sundry; dynamical modeling, climate change and air quality sets the pace as my areas of interest in research. "
