- name: Patrick Addo
  bio: "<p align='justify'>Patrick Addo is a qualitative researcher of CHORUS project II at the University of Ghana School of Public Health. CHORUS (Community-led Responsive and Effective Urban Health Systems), a research programme consortium, seeks to help address urban health challenges in poor urban communities through a demand-driven approach that brings together stakeholders from the community to higher-level policymakers to identify and find solutions to health challenges for the urban poor. Patrick is driven by his passion to address pressing societal health issues through rigorous scientific methods and hopes to improve and contribute to the building of resilient, healthy and smart urban centres. With the world inundated with a plethora of data (both numbers and text), Patrick seeks to find innovative approaches to analyse and draw insights to inform policies specifically to the contribution of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 3 and 11, which emphasises good health and building a healthy and resilient city respectively. Before CHORUS, Patrick has worked as a freelance researcher participating in national informing health policy projects like the Community-based Health and Planning Services (CHPS) plus and Developing Acute Care and Emergency Systems (ACERS). He is the manager of Penuel-Charis Research Consultancy, a start-up research firm which is currently a grant holder from the Ministry of Environmental Science and Technology of Ghana, exploring the feasibility of using a web-based application to scale up mass drug administration for schistosomiasis following Covid-19 pandemic in the Volta and Oti regions of Ghana.</p>"
