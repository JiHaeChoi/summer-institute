  bio: "Agnes Horvat is an Associate Professor of Communication and Computer Science (by courtesy) at Northwestern University. Her research lies at the intersection of human-centered computing, computational social science, and communication. Using interdisciplinary approaches, her research group, the Lab on Innovation, Networks, and Knowledge (LINK), investigates how networks induce biased information production, sharing, and processing on digital platforms. For example, they study the impact of networks and diversity on scholarly communication, identify expressions of collective intelligence and opportunities for innovation in crowdsourcing communities, and develop tools to support creativity and predict success in culture industries. Agnes developed courses on networks, media, and AI to train students for careers at the intersection of creative occupations and data science. Her research and teaching have been recognized with an NSF CAREER and CRII Award. She received her PhD in Physics from the University of Heidelberg, Germany. Prior to becoming a faculty member at Northwestern, she was a postdoctoral fellow at the Northwestern Institute on Complex Systems (NICO)."

  bio: "Dino Pinterpe Christenson is Professor (Ph.D., Ohio State University; B.A., University of Michigan) in the Department of Political Science at Washington University, a Faculty Affiliate in the Division of Computational and Data Science, and a Research Fellow at the Weidenbaum Center on the Economy, Government, and Public Policy. Christenson studies American political behavior and quantitative methods, with recent work exploring presidential voting behavior, campaign dynamics in presidential primaries and caucuses, the coalition behavior of interest groups, and public opinion and the media environment of institutional outcomes. More generally, his research in American politics concerns electoral behavior, public opinion, political psychology, political communication, interest groups and judicial politics. He has broad methodological interests as well, including survey research, experimental design, longitudinal and nested data models, Bayesian analysis, social network analysis and causal inference."

  bio: "Bruce Desmarais is Professor in the Department of Political Science and Faculty Co-Hire of the Institute for Computational and Data Sciences at Penn State University. Professor Desmarais' research focuses on the development and application of statistical methods in the study of Social and Political systems that are characterized by interdependence and structural complexity.  Network analysis is the primary methodological approach in his research. Areas of application include international conflict and cooperation among countries, campaign finance and  co-sponsorship networks in the US Congress, digital communication networks in local government, diffusion of public policies across the US states, and the interconnectedness of scientific research and US regulatory policymaking.  His current research agenda is generously supported by three grants from the US National Science foundation and one from the Russell Sage Foundation."

  bio: "Bryce Dietrich is Associate Professor in the Department of Political Science at Purdue University and research scholar at the Center for C-SPAN Scholarship and Engagement (CCSE). His research uses novel quantitative, automated, and machine learning methods to analyze non-traditional data sources such as audio (or speech) data and video data. These methods are used to understand the causes and consequences of non-verbal cues, such as vocal inflections and walking trajectories, especially as they relate to elite political behavior."
