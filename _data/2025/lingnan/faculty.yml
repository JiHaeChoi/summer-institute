    Frankie Ho Chun Wong studies the intersection between digital media, health, and society. 
    Frankie obtained his Ph.D. from Philip Merrill College of Journalism, University of Maryland, 
    College Park. Prior to that, he worked at The University of Hong Kong on ageing and mental 
    health research. Frankie employs machine learning, natural language processing, and mixed 
    methods techniques, looking for nuances in the sea of data. His work examines how social and 
    policy issues were shaped by new media and technology in the digital age, as well as the 
    influence of social and demographic factors on media use and health outcomes.
