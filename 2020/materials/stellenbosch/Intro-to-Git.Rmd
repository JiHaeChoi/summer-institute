Git is a piece of software for version control. Version Control Systems are a class of software products used to maintain the history of files and their content. Git is a variant of version control system known as distributed version control and can be used to keep copies of files and their histories on many systems. It differs from other systems in that the entire history of the files is stored on every computer used in the process.

This document incorporates conceptual content as well as images from the definitive, and open, text on Git: [Pro Git 2nd Edition](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub.

### Git Installation

Installation of Git is highly dependent on the platform which it is being installed on. On Windows, Git can be installed from its [website](https://git-scm.com/download/win), or through the use of the [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) application. For Visual Studio users, it is also available through the Visual Studio Installer.

On MacOS, it is usually installed alongside XCode or the XCode Command Line Tools. This is usually achieved by running the command `xcode-select --install` in a Terminal session.

On Linux, Git may be pre-installed, otherwise is available in all package managers. On Debian based systems, the package is known as `git`.

More detailed instructions, with additional scenarios, are available in the [textbook](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

### Using The Terminal

Git is fundamentally a Terminal (or command line) application. That is, it has no graphical interface. There are many graphical applications that have been developed to help manage Git Repositories, but they are diverse and will not be discussed here. An exception to this is RStudio itself, which will be discussed in a later part of the documentation.

The choice of shell program is usually a personal one. For novice users on MacOS, the default shell in recent versions is `zsh` and `bash` for older versions. The default shell on most Linux distros is `bash`.

On Windows, the default shell is known as the Command Prompt. This legacy shell is a remnant of the time when Windows was an application for DOS and is best avoided, as it has has had only limited updates since DOS was discontinued some 25 years ago. Most modern versions of Windows ship with an additional shell program known as PowerShell, which is recommended. Installation of Git will result in `bash` also being installed and you will find a start menu entry under Git Bash to access Git through that interface. Use of the built in Terminal in RStudio will use your default shell on Linux ans MacOS, and Git Bash, if it available, on Windows.

This guide will focus on `bash` and PowerShell as a result. The commands function almost exactly the same way in `bash`, `zsh` and PowerShell.

You can verify that Git is installed and working correctly by running it with no arguments:
```{bash}
git
```
### Configuring Git

You should always configure two aspects of Git on a new computer before starting to work with it. This is because with each commit, Git stores information about who made the commit. To do this, you should run these two commands with your own information:
```{bash}
git config --global user.name "John Doe"
git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
```

GitHub users should use the special hidden e-mail address available in the website's e-mail settings.

Windows users who collaborate with users on other platforms may wish to also look into the line ending settings.

### Getting A Git Repository

There are two principal methods for obtaining a Git repository (or repo) by using the `git` command. The first creates a completely new repository in the current folder, while the second will obtain an existing repo from an external source.

_A new repo:_
```{bash}
git init
```

_An existing repo hosted on GitHub (cloned into a new sub-directory):_
```{bash}
git clone https://github.com/username/Intro-to-R.git
```

### Adding Files to Git

Git tracks the state and history of files that it is told to track. Files in a Git folder that are explicitly added to Git will not be tracked.

You can obtain information about the status of files in a Git repo using the git status command:
```{bash}
git status
```
This command shows which files are in the different states Git understands. The state of files is discussed further below.

To add a new file, or to _update_ an existing file in Git, it must be added to the repo:
```{bash}
git add Intro-to-Git.Rmd
git status
```
Adding a file to Git tells the software that it should track the file, as well as any changes to the file, but doesn't actually store these changes. To store the changes into Git, we must commit the file to Git's memory. You can perform a commit for one file, or many at the same time. Git stores a message with each commit, which describes the changes in the commit.
```{bash}
git commit -m "Added the Adding Files section to the Rmd"
```

Note the commit message provided as an argument. Both the `-m` and the quotes are required for it to work correctly.

**Be warned**, you can start a commit without the argument (just `git commit`) but it will launch into a text editor for you to provide the commit message. On most platforms this will invoke Vim by default and if you're not familiar with Vim, you might find yourself unable to close the application!

### Moving and Removing Files

Files can be moved and removed from git using special versions of the commands that will be familiar to users of `bash` or other Unix shells. The `rm` command removes files, while the `mv` command moves files. The `mv` command also renames files, you move it from the old name to the new one. The special Git version of these commands _must_ be used to ensure that Git knows about the changes.
```{bash}
git mv Intro-to-Git2.Rmd Intro-to-Git-2.Rmd
git rm Intro-to-Git-2.Rmd
```

_(These commands are not shown as they are destructive.)_

### Understanding the Stages of a File in Git

<img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 75%;" src="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/images/lifecycle.png" />

An **Untracked** file is unknown to Git. It has never been _added_, or it has been _removed_ since it was last added.

A **Staged** file is one that has been added to Git (using `git add`) but has not yet been committed.

An **Unmodified** file is one that exists in Git, but has not been changed since it was last committed.

Finally, a **Modified** file is a file that is already known to Git (it had been _added_ in the past), but has been changed and not yet _re-added_.

The flow of how files transition between these four states is shown above (image from Pro Git). It is helpful to understand that only files that are in the _Unmodified_ state are safely stored in the Git repo. The _Staging Area_ is a special state to allow you to add multiple files to the same commit over time.

### Working with GitHub

Git is a _distributed_ version control system. You can connect your repo to one (or as many as you like) remote copies of the same repo. You could, in theory, even have multiple copies of the same repo on the same computer. While, from the perspective of Git, this is easy, Git doesn't automatically connect those computers together.

That's where GitHub comes in. It is largely thanks to GitHub that Git is as popular as it is today. GitHub provides a centralised location where you (and anyone else) can store your remote repositories for later use.

You need to make almost no changes to your existing workflow to use GitHub with your repo. There are just a few basic additional steps you need connect your repo with GitHub and to upload and download your content.

#### Adding a Remote

The first step you need to follow is to tell Git where the other system you wish to sync your repo is. In Git these are called _Remotes_ and if you use GitHub, the interface on a new repo will provide instructions for linking Git to your GitHub project.

The first of GitHub's instructions are for when you don't already have a local repo setup and you need to create one. It combines `git remote` with other commands to create the repo and to force a commit. You cannot link the _remote_ if there is no local commit already.
```{bash}
echo "# Intro-to-Git" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/Intro-to-Git.git
git push -u origin master
```

The second option is when you already have a local repo with content that you wish to link to GitHub. There are fewer commands as the repo already exists:
```{bash}
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/Intro-to-Git.git
git push -u origin master
```

#### Pushing and Pulling

The astute will note that in addition to the call to `git remote`, there is also a call to `git push` in both of the above blocks. To get the latest commits from GitHub you `pull` from the remote; and to send your changes back to the remote, you `push` to it. After the first use of `git push` as per the above, you can simply use `git push` or `git pull` without any arguments to push and pull from GitHub.

Provided that you only use your repo on a single computer and have it linked with a single remote, this is all there is to pushing and pulling from GitHub. Difficulties can arise if you use multiple computers or if you have a project with multiple contributors and the orders of the push and pull are out of sync. More on this in a later section.

### Using RStudio to Manage Git

If all this sounds overwhelming, then perhaps it is time to step back and consider an alternative. Many IDEs, including RStudio, have support for Git built into the system. This allows you to manage your Git repos without using the command line. It is possible to avoid the command line entirely in RStudio's interface.

By default you will not notice the Git window or the any mention of Git in the interface. THis is because it is required in RStudio to have a project when making use of the Git features. You can use the New Project command to link to either an existing repo (hosted on GitHub, for example) or to create a new project and initialise the repo.

Exploring these features is left as an exercise. It is suggested that you take your work and commit it to a Git repo and host it on GitHub.

### Working with Branches

It you were to ask the Git developers about Git's best feature, they would undoubtedly describe branches. Most version control systems have some form of branching built in, but few (if any) are as flexible as those available in Git. Branching is conceptually an advanced topic and this guide will only mention the basics.

Branches are simple labels that can be applied to commits. There are some special labels that always exist, but by default every repo has one branch (currently normally called `master` but this is starting to change). This label moves along with your commit as you make more commits. The special `HEAD` label applies to the current branch in the current working directory. The following visualises some commits with the default branch. It also has another label `v1.0` which is a special type of label called a Tag that doesn't move as you add more commits.

<img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 75%;" src="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/images/branch-and-history.png" />

You can add additional branches by using the `git branch` command. This command will create a new branch, but not switch to it. You would normally create a branch and switch to it directly. We call this switching `checking out`.
```{bash}
git branch testing
git checkout testing
```
Having performed those commands, the tree may now look like this:
<img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 75%;" src="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/images/head-to-testing.png" />

You can see from the image that there are now two labels associated with the `f30ab` commit. Because `HEAD` is now associated with the `testing` branch, any commits now will advance the `testing` branch, but not the `master` branch. For example:

<img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 75%;" src="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/images/advance-testing.png" />

If you checkout the `master` branch at this point, the `HEAD` will be moved back to the associated commit and the content of your working directory will change back to this commit.

<img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 75%;" src="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/images/checkout-master.png" />

If you add additional commits to `master` at this point, the two branches will being to diverge. This means that you can have content in one branch that doesn't exist in the other branch or that branch's history:

<img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 75%;" src="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/images/advance-master.png" />

You can link these two branches by _merging_ them together. The command `git merge` will copy the current branch back into another.

```{bash}
git merge master
```
In this case, the two branches are already in sync, so it just moves the labels together.

[A more detailed introduction to this topic can be found in the textbook, which works through each commit step-by-step.](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging)

Using branches effectively allows you to build a full multi-user workflow. GitHub introduces additional tools on top of this feature, which you are encouraged to learn more about on their [website](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).

As branching is usually a more difficult topic, you may wish to start with just a single branch on Git and move to a multi-branch workflow once you are more comfortable.

### Structuring Your Project

There are as many project structures for your data analysis project as there are projects. However if you are looking for some structure that you may wish to adopt, have a look at the [Cookiecutter Data Science](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/) project.
