From May 26 to June 6, 2025, The University of Edinburgh will host the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science, to be held in Edinburgh, United Kingdom. The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and faculty interested in computational social science. The Summer Institute is for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived).

The instructional program will involve lectures, group problem sets, and participant-led research projects, with a special emphasis on causal inference. There will also feature guest speakers conducting computational social science research across academia, industry, and government. Topics covered include causal inference with observational data, text analysis, network analysis, survey experiments, and machine learning. Participants will have ample opportunities to discuss their research and ideas with organisers, peers, and visiting speakers. Committed to open and reproducible research, we will release all materials created by faculty and students as open-source resources.

Participation is restricted to advanced Ph.D. students, postdoctoral researchers, and junior faculty (within 7 years of their Ph.D). We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially junior faculty from neighboring institutions near Edinburgh, United Kingdom. About 25-30 participants will be invited. Most participants are expected to fully attend and participate in the entire two-week program, but we are open to alternative arrangements for faculty members. 

Application materials are due on **March 21st, 2025, 23:59 GMT**.
Inquiries can be sent to [Meera.Gopakumar@ed.ac.uk](Meera.Gopakumar@ed.ac.uk).
