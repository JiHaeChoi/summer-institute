From June 16 to June 27, 2025 Lingnan University will host the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science, to be held in Hong Kong SAR. The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and faculty interested in computational social science. The Summer Institute is for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived).

The instructional program will involve lectures, group problem sets, and participant-led research projects. There will also be outside speakers who conduct computational social science research in a variety of settings, such as academia, industry, and government. Topics covered include data extraction, supervised text analysis, unsupervised text analysis, and image analysis. There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source.

Participation is restricted to advanced Ph.D. students, postdoctoral researchers, and junior faculty (within 7 years of their Ph.D). We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially junior faculty from neighboring institutions near Hong Kong SAR. About 20 participants will be invited. Most participants are expected to fully attend and participate in the entire 10-day program, but we are open to alternative arrangements for faculty members. 

Application materials are due on March 16.
